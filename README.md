# Event KeyCodes Project

This project demonstrates how to capture keyboard events and display key details such as `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` in a dynamically updated table.

## Features

- Capture `keydown` events and display key details in real-time.
- Display the key name, keycode, and the code associated with each key press.
- Support for spacebar, showing "Space" instead of the space character.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Press any key on the keyboard.
3. The table will dynamically update to display the key details:
   - **Key**: The key you pressed (e.g., "A", "1", "Space").
   - **KeyCode**: The numeric code associated with the key.
   - **Code**: The physical key code (e.g., "KeyA", "Space").

## Example:

When you press the "A" key, the table will show:

| Key | Keycode | Code  |
|-----|---------|-------|
| A   | 65      | KeyA  |

When you press the spacebar, the table will show:

| Key   | Keycode | Code    |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Space | 32      | Space   |

## Installation

This project does not require any installation. Simply download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Styling

Basic styling is applied using CSS to make the table readable and the page visually appealing. You can further customize the styles in `style.css` to suit your preferences.
